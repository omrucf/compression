The program starts by asking the user to choose from two options: compress or decompress.

After the user chooses, if:

1. "Compress" is chosen, the program asks the user to input the address of the file he wants to compress.

The program creates a new ".bin" file in the same directory as the source code containing the compressed version of the inputted file by the user.

The program then shows to the user the compression ratio and the efficiency rate.

2. "Decompress" is chosen, the program searches for a file in the directory named "comressed.bin" and if found, it decompresses it and creates a new ".txt" file named "decomressed" in the same directory containting the decompressed version. Else if not found, it outputs to the user that no compressed files are found.
